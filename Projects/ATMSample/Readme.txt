C# ATM Practice
This is a sample of a slightly modified (to C#) ATM project based off of an already exisiting Java program from Crutch The Clutch.
Although the original program is written in Java, the similarities it shares with C# helped me to understand in creating and
incorporating multiple classes to a larger program.
